# JR3 Mbed firmware

An MBED 2 application that performs data acquisition from a JR3 force-torque sensor and streams it through a CAN channel.

Incidentally, support was added for sending simple PWM commands to a Lacquey fetch hand through a secondary optional CAN channel.

## Installation

Since the Mbed Online Compiler has been discontinued, development and compilation should be carried out at https://studio.keil.arm.com/. Make sure you select "mbed LPC1768" as the compilation target. Once build, plug in the MBED to a USB port of your PC and drag-and-drop the downloaded .bin file into it.

Bolded incoming commands imply that the Mbed will respond with an acknowledge message.

## Usage

On bootup, the calibration matrix and full scales are queried from the sensor and stored for later use. If successful, the bootup message is sent. This may take a few seconds from initial power up. A failure means that there is no connection to the sensor. Re-initialization may be requested during normal operation through the "reset" command. If the initialization succeeds, the JR3 controller is in "ready" state, otherwise it remains in "not initialized" state. All acknowledge messages carry this state information in their payload. The "get state" command is a no-op that can be used to ping the controller.

The JR3 sensor operates in two modes: synchronous and asynchronous. Both entail that a background thread will be performing data acquisition, decoupling, offset removal and filtering at full sensor bandwidth (8 KHz per channel).

- Synchronous ("start sync" command): per the CiA 402 standard (a.k.a. CANopen), a SYNC message is broadcast over the CAN network by a producer node so that consumers act upon (e.g. send sensor data, accept motion commands). As soon as the incoming SYNC message is processed, the Mbed will send the latest force and moment data in return.
- Asynchronous ("start async" command): an additional thread is spawned to query latest forces and moments at the specified fixed rate (tested at 1 ms).

An initial offset is substracted from the decoupled sensor data. To calibrate the sensor again (i.e. set the latest measurements as the new zero), the "zero offsets" command can be issued at any time.

It is highly recommended to enable raw data filtering by specifying the desired cutoff frequency to either start command. This firmware implements a simple first-order low-pass IIR filter, also known as an exponential moving average (see [Wikipedia article](https://w.wiki/7Er6)). Its cutoff frequency can be modified through the "set filter" command.

Outgoing force and moment data requires post-processing on the receiver's side. These signed integer values should be multiplied by the corresponding full scale and divided by a factor of 16384 (=2^14) for forces and 16384\*10 for moments. The resulting values will be expressed in Newtons and Newton*meters, respectively.

## Configuration

See [mbed-app.json](mbed_app.json) for a list of configurable parameters and their description. The project should be recompiled after any changes to this file.

## Extra tools

Most Linux kernels should support [SocketCAN](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/next/networking/can.html). In order to create a network interface for a CAN channel with a baudrate of 1 Mbps, run the following command:

```
sudo ip link set can0 up txqueuelen 1000 type can bitrate 1000000
```

To send a CAN message, install the [can-utils](https://github.com/linux-can/can-utils) package (`apt install can-utils`) and run:

```
cansend can0 281#C80010270000
```

This will start an ASYNC publisher on ID 1 with a period of 10 ms (10000 us = 0x2710) and a cutoff frequency of 2 Hz (200 Hz*0.01 = 0x00C8). Use the `candump can0` command on a different terminal to inspect traffic on the CAN bus, including any response from the Mbed.

A helper Python script is provided for visual inspection of filtered data, [can-plotter.py](can-plotter.py). Example usage (channels: `fx`, `fy`, `fz`, `mx`, `my`, `mz`):

```
candump can0 | python3 can-plotter.py --id 1 --channel fz
```
