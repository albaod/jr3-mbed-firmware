# JR3 Mbed firmware

An MBED 2 application that performs data acquisition from a JR3 force-torque sensor and streams it through a CAN channel.

Incidentally, support was added for sending simple PWM commands to a Lacquey fetch hand through a secondary optional CAN channel.

## Installation

Since Mbed Online Compiler has been discontinued, development and compilation should be carried out at https://studio.keil.arm.com/. Make sure you select "mbed LPC1768" as the compilation target. Once build, plug in the MBED to a USB port of your PC and drag-and-drop the downloaded .bin file into it.
