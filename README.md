# JR3 Mbed firmware

An MBED 2 application that performs data acquisition from a JR3 force-torque sensor and streams it through a CAN channel.

Incidentally, support was added for sending simple PWM commands to a Lacquey fetch hand through a secondary optional CAN channel.

## Installation

Since Mbed Online Compiler has been discontinued, development and compilation should be carried out at https://studio.keil.arm.com/. Make sure you select "mbed LPC1768" as the compilation target. Once build, plug in the MBED to a USB port of your PC and drag-and-drop the downloaded .bin file into it.

Bolded incoming commands imply that the Mbed will respond with an acknowledge message (following other generated response messages, if any, as in "get full scales").
